This project is dependent on the following files:

SSubTmr6.dll
TLBINF32.DLL
vbalIml6.ocx
vbalSGrid6.ocx
BSTRAPI.TLB

As PSC removes binary files from uploaded .zip files for security reasons
you either have to download these files seperately on your own or you can
use my workaround by simply opening the help project "ResSaver.vbp" that I've included
and run it. That project simply extracts a file called "DLLs.zip" to the project dir.
Then you only have extract these libraries to your
%SystemDrive%:\Windows\System32\
folder and register them.

Have fun!
